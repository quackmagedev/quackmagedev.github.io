# âœ¨ About Me

Iâ€™m an independent game developer exploring storytelling through mechanics and atmosphere.  

Expect **devlogs**, **concept art**, and **small experimental releases** soon.  

Outside of my projects, I enjoy spending time with my wife and picking up new languages.

## ðŸ”® My Philosophy

Games are magic: tiny systems that can surprise, delight, and challenge.  
I love experimenting with quirky mechanics and humor in games.
