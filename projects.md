# 🧪 Projects

Welcome to my little lab of experiments!

Here’s what I’m working on, plus a few ideas I’m cooking up:

---

## 🕹️ Current Project

🎨 **Nick the Shape Man**  
A fast shape-shifting adventure to restore color to a lost world.
> Made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## 💡 Upcoming Ideas

- 🐸 **Frogs with Jobs** — a silly frog game with offbeat employment adventures.
- 🏰 **Catacomb Crypt** — a dungeon crawl roguelike full of traps, treasures, and chaos.
