# 🧪 Projects

Welcome to my little lab of experiments!  
Here’s what I’m working on, plus a few ideas I’m cooking up:

---

## 🎨 Nick the Shape Man
A fast shape-shifting adventure to restore color to a lost world.  
Switch forms, solve puzzles, and explore quirky environments.  
> Built in **Godot** • WIP

## 💡 Upcoming Ideas

- 🐸 **Frogs with Jobs** — a silly frog game with offbeat employment adventures.  
- 🏰 **Catacomb Crypt** — a dungeon crawl roguelike full of traps, treasures, and chaos.
