Welcome to my corner of the internet!
I make small, weird, and (hopefully) delightful games that experiment with mechanics and storytelling.

## ✨ About Me

I’m an indie game developer exploring storytelling through gameplay, atmosphere, and small experimental worlds.
Expect **devlogs**, **concept art**, and **mini releases** soon.

Currently learning **Godot** and **pixel art**. Outside of my projects, I enjoy spending time with my wife and picking up new languages.
